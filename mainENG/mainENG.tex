%
I am a passionate, pragmatic and goal-driven mechatronics engineer always looking for personal growth opportunities and challenges. This drove me in my academic choices and allowed me to approach the world of autonomous driving.
To pursue my passion, I became a researcher at the University where I had the opportunity to work on optimal control problems and algorithm development for ADAS in collaboration with racing and the industrial world.
My multidisciplinary education allows me to address problems both from the physical and theoretical foundation and its technical implementation. \\
In my work and life, I am always curious, ambitious, open-minded and determined to succeed.

% I am a passionate mechatronics engineer who likes challenges and is always looking for personal growth opportunities. I am a determined man that is not afraid to leave his comfort zone to achieve goals and results. I am curious and always looking beyond appearances trying to optimise and put muy best effort at everything I do.
% From the professional point of view, I am an expert in modelling and control of mechatronic systems with a particular focus at optimal control.

% I have always been fascinated by the unlimited possibilities of technology to change the world and improve life. That is why I decided to become a Computer Engineer. With this idea in mind, I discovered my passion for Control Systems and Artificial Intelligence as a means to find brave new solutions for hard and complex problems. To meet my interests, I specialized in Autonomous Driving and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). People-oriented, analytical, and dynamic, I have a highly creative nature that is balanced by a pragmatic and goal-driven attitude. In my work and life, I am always curious, ambitious, open-minded and I like getting involved with new challenges.
