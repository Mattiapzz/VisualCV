MATTIA PIAZZA

WHO AM I?
I am a passionate, pragmatic and goal-driven mechatronics engineer always looking for personal growth opportunities and challenges. This guided my academic choices and allowed me to approach the world of autonomous driving.
To pursue my passion, I became a University researcher and I had the opportunity to work on optimal control problems and algorithms development for ADAS. I collaborated with partners from the automotive and the motorsport industry.
My multidisciplinary education, combined with my interest in practical applications, allows me to address both theoretical and technical aspects of engineering problems.
In my work and life, I am always curious, ambitious, open-minded and determined to succeed.
